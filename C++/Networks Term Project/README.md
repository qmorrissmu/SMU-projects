# Networks Term Project

For this project, I was tasked with creating an 802.11(WiFi) network simulator that had the ability to create instances of intentional collisions between network nodes to make WiFi more efficient. The findings and further explanation of the project can be found in the term paper in this folder.

## Descriptions of Scripts
- main.cpp: This is the program driver. The idea is that this script carries out all activities and establishes rules for the network nodes to follow while the nodes strictly contain information pertaining to them.

- nnode.h/cpp: The header and implementation files for the network nodes.
